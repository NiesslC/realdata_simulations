<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repository contains the code and results of the manuscript "Statistical parametric simulation studies based on real data" by Christina Sauer, F. Julian D. Lange, Maria Thurow, Ina Dormuth, and Anne-Laure Boulesteix (https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04864). 

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub. -->
